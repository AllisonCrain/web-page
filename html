      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! I'm Allison, a software engineering student in Charleston, SC.</p>
    <p>This is my first time creating a web page. Although this is all very new to me I am so excited to see where this will take me!</p>  
    
    <p>Here are a few of my current roles.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Single mom to my 13 year old daughter</li>
        <li>Respiratory Therapist</li>
        <li>Health and welness coach</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>My Background</h3>

  <p>I grew up in Wisconsin and moved to South Carolina after graduating respiratory school. I have been working in the medical field for 15 years and 4 years ago I also added the role of health and wellness coach. It was in this new role that I became interested in creating a website for myself and decided to learn more about web development. </p>

    <p>In my career as a respiratory therapist there haven't been many opportunities for growth. As a lifelong learner, I think this is one of the things that excites me the most about software development. I am so excited to learn from and work with other developers on projects to grow my skills.</p>
